## What is DVCS?

In computer programming, distributed version control, also known as distributed revision control or decentralized version control, allows many software developers to work on a given project without requiring them to share a common network. The software revisions are stored in a distributed revision control system (DRCS), also known as a distributed version control system (DVCS).
